The site is hosted Vercel for the front end and Heroku for the back end. The code is available on my Github. Fun fact, I didn't know Svelte or FastAPI before I started this project, but I learned them as I went along! I also wasn't super familiar with Heroku or Vercel, but I became very aquainted with them through this. I'm always up for a challenge and love learning new things!",
